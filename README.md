# 🏁 My Summer Kart

_A brutally realistic 90s go-kart sim where everything breaks, nothing works right, and you're already late to the race._

## 🎮 What is this?

**My Summer Kart** is a love letter to mechanical chaos. Build your go-kart from scratch, race against AI, and experience the beauty of tire wear, bad handling, and questionable engineering — all set in a Finnish-ish village straight out of the 90s.

No UI. No hand-holding. Just you, your tools, and your terrible life choices.
